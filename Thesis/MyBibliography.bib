  abstract =     {In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting interest points invariant to scale and affine
                    transformations. Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results : (1) Interest points
                    extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically
                    stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized
                    derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment
                    matrix.
                    Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then
                    selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive
                    points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited
                    changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the
                    scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative
                    algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This
                    method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and
                    the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.
                    We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results
                    than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image
                    is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points.},

                    a new area: object tracking and visual servoing. The system uses computer vision to provide a kind of
                    surrogate sight for the human user; sensing information from the environment and communicating it
                    through haptic signalling. Our proof-of concept prototype is a low-cost wearable system which uses a
                    colour camera to analyze a scene and recognize a desired object, then generate tactile cues to the
                    wearer to steer his or her hand towards the object. We have proved the system in trials with random

The framework provides a model and methodology from which performance metrics can be synthesized based on robotic manipular kinematics and an adaptation of Fitts' law for reaching task motions in a 3D environment. The purpose of which is to facilitate an understanding of how well the system's design accommodates the user's natural movement style when performing the reaching task. Use of advances in visual tracking techniques employing scale, view-point, and illumination invariant features are incorporated to allow for a further decoupling of the feature space from the joint-level control space.},

  abstract =     {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features.
                    The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant
                    to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with
                    neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision.
                    Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points
                    in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing
                    blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as
                    input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final
                    verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the
                    unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved
                    in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds}

  abstract =     {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be
                    used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are
                    invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial
                    range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination.
                    The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with
                    high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an
                    approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching
                    individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor
                    algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
                    finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters.
                    This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving
                    near real-time performance.},

  abstract =     {We seek to discover the object categories depicted in a set of unlabelled images. We
                    achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic Latent
                    Semantic Analysis (pLSA). In text analysis this is used to discover topics in a corpus using
                    the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that
                    an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The
                    model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing
                    SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the
                    visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and
                    their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this
                    unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. [8] on a
                    set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words
                    vocabulary to include "doublets" which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is
                    demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the
                    classifi- cation and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple
                    objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models
                    from an unsupervised analysis of images.}

abstract = {There are about 300,000 visually impaired persons in Japan. Most of them are old persons and, cannot become skillful in using a white cane, even if they make effort to learn how to use a white cane. Therefore, some instruments which support the independent activities of the visually impaired are required. In this paper, we will talk about our developed instrument which support the independent walking of the visually impaired in the indoor space. This instrument is composed of a map information system and a navigation system. In map information system, optical beacons and a receiver are used. Optical beacons are set on the ceiling and emit the position code as infrared signal. A receiver receives signal from beacons and informs a map information by artificial voices. The navigation system can follow the colored guide line which is set on the floor. This system is composed of a white cane and a color sensor which is set on the white cane. This color sensor senses colored guide line on the floor. If the cane is on the line, the cane informs a visually impaired user that he or she is on the guide line by vibration. Five normal subjects who were blindfolded were tested with our developed system. All of them could walk along guide line. And map information system worked well. Therefore, we have concluded that our system will be a very valuable one to support activities of the visually impaired},

This paper outlines the design of a visual support system that provides 3D visual information using 3D virtual sounds. Three-dimensional information, such as distance map, object recognition, and object tracking required for the visually impaired user, is obtained by analyzing images captured by stereo cameras. Using a 3D virtual acoustic display, which relies on Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), the user is informed of the locations and movements of objects. The user's external auditory sense is not impeded as the system uses bone conduction headphones which do not block out environment sounds. The proposed system is expected to be useful in the situations where the infrastructure is incomplete and the situation changes in realtime. We plan experiments using this system to guide users while walking and playing sports. &copy; 2002 IEEE.},

Specific examples of a relational graph descriptor used to control arc position around polyhedral objects are discussed.

abstract = {In order to take advantage of the top speed of manipulators, vision cannot be tightly integrated into the motion control loop. Past visual servo control systems have performed satisfactorily with this constraint, however it can be shown that the task execution time can be reduced if the vision system is de-coupled from the low level motor control system. For reaching, there is a trade-off between the accuracy of a motion and the time required to execute motion. In studies of human motor control this tradeoff is quantified by Fitts Law, a relationship between the motion time, the target distance, and the target width. These studies suggest that vision is not used tightly within the control loop, i.e. as a sensor that is servo-ed on, but rather vision is used to determine where the reaching target is and whether target has been reached successfully. Through a simple robotic example we demonstrate that a similar trade off exists between motion accuracy and the motion execution time for visual guided robot reaching motions},

The idea of effective target width in a one-dimensional pointing task was extended to effective target width in a two-dimensional pointing task using the two-dimensional joint probability density function. The validity of this theoretical definition was empirically verified. In the experiment, the moving direction of the mouse was from lower left to upper right. The approach angle was fixed to 45&deg;. The fit of conventional and new models to the experimental data was compared by means of contribution of the regression line which showed the relationship between the index of difficulty and the mean pointing time. As a result, we could obtain higher values of contribution for the modelling that introduced effective target width than that for the conventional modelling without it. In conclusion, the proposed two-dimensional definition of effective target width may be promising for predicting and modelling pointing time in human-computer interactions},

Based on this, a set of indices were proposed. The index of difficulty and the index of performance were introduced as the general indices for the quality measure of plane pointing movement, which is a basic functional action of upper-limb in human daily life. Five healthy subjects were asked to perform six pointing tasks with different indices of difficulty. All movements were recorded using a Vicon motion analysis system.

abstract = {The 3D simulation of human activity based on physics, kinematics, and dynamics in terrestrial and space environments, is becoming increasingly important. Virtual humans may be used to design tasks in terrestrial environments and analyze their physical workload to maximize success and safety without expensive physical mockups. Previously (J. Lo and D. Metaxas, 1999), we presented an efficient optimal control and recursive dynamics based animation system for simulating and controlling the motion of articulated figures, and implemented the approach to several experiments where the simplified articulated models which has serial/closed-loop chain structures with only small degree-of-freedom (less than seven) each. The computation time is from a few minutes up to 4 hours based on the complexity of the model and how close the initial guess of the motion trajectory is to the optimal solution. The paper presents an improved method which can deal with more complicated kinematic chains (tree structures), as well as larger degree-of-freedom serial/closed-loop chain structures. Motion planning is done by first solving the inverse kinematic problem to generate possible trajectories, which gives us a better initial guess of the motion trajectory than the previous one, and then by solving the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem. For example, minimization of the torques during a simulation under certain constraints is often applied and has its origin in the biomechanics literature. Examples of activities shown are chinup and dipdown in different terrestrial environments as well as zero-gravity self orientation and ladder traversal},

abstract = {Seeking other joint trajectories of human arm in terms of given trajectory of hand is a wide research problem. In this paper, the computational problem of inverse kinematics of arm movement was investigated. On the basis of an eight-DOF arm model, an inverse kinematics algorithm recreating arm motion was developed in accordance with the human's feedback control mechanism of motor. In this method, the comfort level, an ergonomic index was adopted as the performance function of the motor control. Through maximizing the comfort level, human arm movement can be simulated when the end-effector motion is given. This method combines human dynamics and ergonomics. To evaluate the approach, some arm goal-directed movement experiments were carried out. The joint trajectories were predicted with an average R<sup>2</sup>=0.9627 and mean residual error MRE=0.0094 m, which indicates that the presented algorithm provides a feasible method to simulate arm goal-directed movement and can be used as an efficient postural manipulation tool for the virtual reality.

abstract = {Electronic Travel Aids, which transform visual environmental cues into another sensory modality, have been proven to help visually impaired people travel with a greater degree of psychological comfort and independence. The People Sensor is an Electronic Travel Aid designed to address two issues of importance to visually impaired people: inadvertent cane contact with other pedestrians and objects, and speaking to a person who is no longer within hearing range. The device uses pyroelectric and ultrasound sensors to locate and differentiate between animate (human) and inanimate (non-human) obstructions in the detection path. The distance between the user and the obstruction along with the nature of the obstruction (human or non-human) is transmitted via modulated vibrotactile feedback. Armed with advance knowledge of the presence and location of objects and people in the environment, users of The People Sensor can travel with increased independence, safety and confidence},

The target size was varied across blocks of trials. Hand movement time increased when the target size was decreased. Interestingly, the magnitude of the integrated EMG activity of lower limb muscles (TAi, TFLc, RFi) decreased with a decreasing target size, while that of the erector spinae increased. The effects were observed as early as 200 ms before the hand movement onset. When standing, these early commands could influence the control of the hand during the acceleration phase. The target size was specified within the postural command before any hand movement took place suggesting the characteristics of the pointing task were integrated in a feedforward manner.}

This allows the previously empirical parameters of Fitts' speed and accuracy law (1954) to be determined before system construction. Fitts' law may now serve a role as a predictive design engineering tool for new systems as well as in its traditional role of after-the-fact analysis. The target-threshold model successfully characterized human control movement times, before system construction, in experiments involving camera pointing for a new class of point-and-direct telerobotics. Employing the natural logarithm as the basis for indexing task difficulty, the slope and intercept parameters were found by analysis of calculated step response trajectories at progressively tighter normalized target thresholds corresponding to increasing distances between targets. Tests validated the model for human subjects using the experimental apparatus of the Stanford Point-And-Direct (PAD) Telerobot for which tasks are developed using phrases such as “put that there”. The target-threshold model is a tool for human factors engineers and control system designers that allows fundamental control theory techniques to be used to predict speed of response for new human-machine systems. The technique allows system developers to compare performance of prospective human-machine systems},

abstract={The hybrid control systems considered here consist of a continuous plant under the control of a discrete event system. Communication between the plant and controller is provided by an interface that can convert signal from the continuous domain to the symbolic domain, and vise-versa. Hybrid control system design generally involves designing a controller, possibly designing some or all of the interface, and in some cases, designing a continuous controller that will become part of the continuous-time plant. This paper examines the case where the interface is partially given, along with the plant and a set of control goals. A method is presented which designs the symbol generating portion of the interface and also yields a controller for the system. The method is based on the natural invariants of the plant. This technique is illustrated by an example in which the design process is simulated via a computer program for an unmanned underwater vehicle},

We introduce a 3D environment where a virtual human performs reaching tasks over 3D objects in the world. This environment also provides tools to generate and visualize reachable volumes. Reachable spaces are approximated using adjacent box-shaped voxels. We define several strategies in order to model different types of reaching, and we employ our system to construct and analyze reachable spaces for these strategies. In general, different strategies do have reachable spaces that share a common region of intersection. Therefore, goals exists that can be reached using two or more strategies. For those goals, a high-level layer is responsible for selecting the most appropriate given a certain reaching task. As a practical application, this paper presents a comparison of two usual strategies to model standing and seated reaching. The generated reach spaces show that, for each of them, a strategy is clearly more adequate than the other.},

abstract = "The target width of a single target in a two-target reciprocal aiming task was scaled from small (ID = 5.85) to large (ID = 2.85) and large-to-small within individual trials with movement amplitude fixed. Scaling target width produced a transition in the end-effector’s dynamics and based on a measure of movement harmonicity, the transition was sensitive to the initial conditions but not to the direction of target width scaling. Hysteresis emerged in a variety of kinematic measures suggesting that the interdependency of planning and feedback control processes was sensitive to initial conditions as well as the direction of target width scaling. Practice increased the efficiency of the reciprocal movements and produced changes in movement time and the measure of harmonic motion that revealed a tuning of the end-effector’s dynamics to cyclical motion over as large of range of IDs as possible. The tuning occurred through the modulation of time spent accelerating and decelerating the end-effector for IDs outside the range of 3.85–4.26. The results are discussed with reference to a critical ID boundary that separates regions of parameter space wherein the end-effector’s dynamics are more cyclical (limit-cycle) or discrete (fixed-point) in nature."

abstract={Can discrete, single-shot movements and continuous, cyclical movements be reduced to a single concept? In the classical, computational approach to human motor behaviour, cyclical aimed movement has generally been considered to derive from discrete primitives through a concatenation mechanism. Much importance, accordingly, has been attached to discrete-movement paradigms and to techniques allowing the segmentation of continuous data. An alternative approach, suggested by the nonlinear dynamical systems theory, views discreteness as a limiting case of cyclicity. Although attempts have been made recently to account for discrete movements in dynamical terms, cyclical paradigms have been favoured. The concatenation interpretation of cyclical aimed movement is criticized on the ground that it implies a complete waste of mechanical energy once in every half-cycle. Some kinematic data from a one-dimensional reciprocal (i.e., cyclical) aiming experiment are reported, suggesting that human subjects do save mascular efforts from one movement to the next in upper-limb cyclical aiming. The experiment demonstrated convergence on simple harmonic motion as aiming tolerance was increased, an outcome interpreted with reference to Hooke's law, in terms of the muscles' capability of storing potential, elastic energy across movement reversals. Not only is the concatenation concept problematic for understanding cyclical aimed movements, but the very reality of discrete movements is questionable too. It is pointed out that discrete motor acts of real life are composed of complete cycles, rather than half-cycles.},

Similar to previous approaches the Tactile Wayfinder uses a tactile torso display to present the directions of a route’s waypoints to the user. It advances those approaches by conveying the location of the next two waypoints rather than the next one only, so the user already knows how the route continues when reaching a waypoint. Using a within-subjects design, fourteen participants navigated along two routes in a busy city centre with the Tactile Wayfinder and a commercial pedestrian navigation system. We measured the acquisition of spatial knowledge, the level of attention the participants had to devote to the navigation task, and the navigation performance. We found that the Tactile Wayfinder freed the participants’ attention but could not keep up with the navigation system in terms of navigation performance. No significant difference was found in the acquisition of spatial knowledge. Instead, a good general sense of direction was highly correlated with good spatial knowledge acquisition and a good navigation performance.},

abstract={This paper investigates the feasibility of creating spatially moving vibrotactile sensations using two vibrotactile actuators in a mobile device. The idea is based on well-known tactile illusions of apparent tactile motion and Â¿phantomÂ¿ sensation. The phantom sensation refers to a perceptual phenomenon where spatially separated vibrotactile actuators that stimulate different skin zones induce a single tactile sensation midway between the two stimulation points. We tested whether such sensation can also be elicited in a mobile device via a psychophysical experiment that employed an open response paradigm. Experimental conditions differed in vibration rendering method, signal duration, and sensation movement direction. The subjects answered the perceived positions and intensities of vibrotactile sensations by drawing graphs with respect to time. The results demonstrated that such Â¿vibrotactile flowÂ¿ can be reliably produced in a mobile device and that a performance trade-off exists depending on the method and signal duration used for rendering. The findings of this paper can be applied to the user interface design of a mobile device with enriched vibrotactile sensations and an improved information transfer bandwidth.},

Exp I (11 undergraduates) demonstrated that withdrawing visual feedback information from the initial portions of aiming responses has little effect on movement outcome. This finding suggested that visual processing times may be faster than previous estimates. The vision manipulation paradigm employed in Exp I was combined with high-speed cinematography techniques in Exp II (3 Ss) to obtain a direct estimate of visual processing time. Examination of movement patterns indicated that the average time between the presentation of visual error information and the initiation of a movement correction was 135 msec. Findings support the contention that the time needed to process visual error information and to use this information for movement control is shorter than previous estimates of 190-300 msec.

abstract={In this paper, the supervisory control of hybrid systems is introduced and discussed at length. Such control systems typically arise in the computer control of continuous processes, for example, in manufacturing and chemical processes, in transportation systems, and in communication networks. A functional architecture of hybrid control systems consisting of a continuous plant, a discrete-event controller, and an interface is used to introduce and describe analysis and synthesis concepts and approaches. Our approach highlights the interaction between the continuous and discrete dynamics, which is the cornerstone of any hybrid system study. Discrete abstractions are used to approximate the continuous plant. Properties of the discrete abstractions to be appropriate representations of the continuous plant are presented, and important concepts such as determinism and controllability are discussed. Supervisory control design methodologies are presented to satisfy control specifications described by formal languages. Several examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate our approach},

abstract = {Seeking other joint trajectories of human arm in terms of given trajectory of hand is a wide research problem. In this paper, the computational problem of inverse kinematics of arm movement was investigated. On the basis of an eight-DOF arm model, an inverse kinematics algorithm recreating arm motion was developed in accordance with the human's feedback control mechanism of motor. In this method, the comfort level, an ergonomic index was adopted as the performance function of the motor control. Through maximizing the comfort level, human arm movement can be simulated when the end-effector motion is given. This method combines human dynamics and ergonomics. To evaluate the approach, some arm goal-directed movement experiments were carried out. The joint trajectories were predicted with an average R<sup>2</sup>=0.9627 and mean residual error MRE=0.0094 m, which indicates that the presented algorithm provides a feasible method to simulate arm goal-directed movement and can be used as an efficient postural manipulation tool for the virtual reality.

abstract = {The 3D simulation of human activity based on physics, kinematics, and dynamics in terrestrial and space environments, is becoming increasingly important. Virtual humans may be used to design tasks in terrestrial environments and analyze their physical workload to maximize success and safety without expensive physical mockups. Previously (J. Lo and D. Metaxas, 1999), we presented an efficient optimal control and recursive dynamics based animation system for simulating and controlling the motion of articulated figures, and implemented the approach to several experiments where the simplified articulated models which has serial/closed-loop chain structures with only small degree-of-freedom (less than seven) each. The computation time is from a few minutes up to 4 hours based on the complexity of the model and how close the initial guess of the motion trajectory is to the optimal solution. The paper presents an improved method which can deal with more complicated kinematic chains (tree structures), as well as larger degree-of-freedom serial/closed-loop chain structures. Motion planning is done by first solving the inverse kinematic problem to generate possible trajectories, which gives us a better initial guess of the motion trajectory than the previous one, and then by solving the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem. For example, minimization of the torques during a simulation under certain constraints is often applied and has its origin in the biomechanics literature. Examples of activities shown are chinup and dipdown in different terrestrial environments as well as zero-gravity self orientation and ladder traversal},

   abstract = {In control, stability captures the reproducibility of motions and the robustness to environmental and internal perturbations. This paper examines how stability can be evaluated in human movements, and possible mechanisms by which humans ensure stability. First, a measure of stability is introduced, which is simple to apply to human movements and corresponds to Lyapunov exponents. Its application to real data shows that it is able to distinguish effectively between stable and unstable dynamics. A computational model is then used to investigate stability in human arm movements, which takes into account motor output variability and computes the force to perform a task according to an inverse dynamics model. Simulation results suggest that even a large time delay does not affect movement stability as long as the reflex feedback is small relative to muscle elasticity. Simulations are also used to demonstrate that existing learning schemes, using a monotonic antisymmetric update law, cannot compensate for unstable dynamics. An impedance compensation algorithm is introduced to learn unstable dynamics, which produces similar adaptation responses to those found in experiments.},

title={An investigation of the effect of display augmentation with instantaneous movement information on telemanipulation performance under visual-motor mismatch},
school={University of Toronto},
abstract={A review is presented of the well documented difficulties in performing manual control tasks under visual-motor mismatch. In that light, a new display concept is proposed, where additional visual information about a telemanipulated instruments direction of instantaneous movement is graphically superimposed at the instrument tips location in a camera image. An experimental platform is developed to evaluate the new display concept in a pointing task, under various camera misalignments and path constraints. Both global and dynamic measures are used to evaluate recorded movement trajectories, including a novel analysis of distributions of bivariate time and space domain parameters. The reported performance decrement is consistent with the literature; however, the global and dynamic measures analyses suggest that the proposed display concept offered no significant improvement over the case of no additional visual information in the experiment reported.},

abstract = "Reaching movements can be described in many different coordinate frameworks, from the path of the hand through space, to the patterns of causative muscle contractions. It is logical, therefore, to propose that the brain contains representations of reaching movements in each of these reference frames, and controls movement by making serial transformations of movement-related signals among the coordinate frameworks. The transformation from the desired kinematic parameters of movement (direction, velocity, amplitude, etc) to the requisite parameters of movement dynamics (forces, torques, muscle activity) is a particularly complex problem in the skeletomotor system. Although our understanding of motor control processes is advancing rapidly, there is still surprisingly little conclusive evidence concerning the neuronal mechanisms of this serial hierarchical model for the planning of reaching movements. Parallel-processing mechanisms are also likely to be very important."

Endpoint dynamics, which characterizes the relationship between hand displacements and resulting forces, was estimated during the application of three-dimensional stochastic displacement perturbations applied to the endpoint of the arm. The dynamic input-output relations between the displacements and the forces were determined using a frequency domain nonparametric system identification technique. Endpoint inertia, viscosity and stiffness parameters were fit to the identified system. A graphical technique was introduced to help visualize these complex dynamic parameters. The results illustrate the importance of studying the endpoint dynamics in three dimensions.},

In these tasks, the arm is usually constrained to the environmental geometry. Although there are infinite possibilities for human subject to select his/her arm trajectories as well as interacting forces when performing the tasks, experiments of human constrained motion however show that there clearly exist some characteristics inherent in all measurement data. Specifically, in this research, it is shown that, when human rotating a crank, he/she optimizes the criterion that minimizes the change of both the end-effector force as well as the muscle forces. This numerical result is strongly supported by human experiments data. Since this criterion is different from the minimum torque change criterion proposed to evaluate human reaching movement in free motion space, it is then suggested that human may use different optimal strategies with respect to different task requirements as well as environmental conditions},

Kinematic models are built to study human upper limb motion in three-dimension, based on measurements of the wrist motion. A simulated annealing based optimisation method is adopted to reduce errors in measurements. Experimental results demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed system in real motion circumstances},

TITLE={Moving Forward in Structure From Motion},
AUTHOR={Andrea Vedaldi and Gregorio Guidi and Stefano Soatto},
JOURNAL={Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2007. CVPR '07. IEEE Conference on},
year={17-22 June 2007},
pages={1-7},
abstract={It is well-known that forward motion induces a large number of local minima in the instantaneous least-squares reprojection error. This is caused in part by singularities in the error landscape around the forward direction, and presents a challenge in using existing algorithms for structure-from-motion in autonomous navigation applications. In this paper we prove that imposing a bound on the reconstructed depth of the scene makes the least-squares reprojection error continuous. This has implications for autonomous navigation, as it suggests simple modifications for existing algorithms to minimize the effects of local minima in forward translation.},

  abstract =     {In this paper a complete system to build visual models from camera images is presented.
                    The system can deal with uncalibrated image sequences acquired with a hand-held camera.
                    Based on tracked or matched features the relations between multiple views are computed.
                    From this both the structure of the scene and the motion of the camera are retrieved. The
                    ambiguity on the reconstruction is restricted from projective to metric through self-calibration.
                    A flexible multi-view stereo matching scheme is used to obtain a dense estimation of the surface
                    geometry. From the computed data different types of visual models are constructed. Besides the
                    traditional geometry- and image-based approaches, a combined approach with view-dependent geometry
                    and texture is presented. As an application fusion of real and virtual scenes is also shown.}

@ARTICLE{HOFFMANN06,
title={Visual Servoing with Moments of SIFT Features},
author={Frank Hoffmann and Thomas Nierobisch and Torsten Seyffarth and Gunter Rudolph},
journal={Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 2006. SMC '06. IEEE International Conference on},
year={8-11 Oct. 2006},
volume={5},
pages={4262-4267},
abstract={Robotic manipulation of daily-life objects is an essential requirement in service robotic applications. In that context image based visual servoing is a means to position the end-effector in order to manipulate objects of unknown pose. This contribution proposes a 6 DOF visual servoing scheme that relies on the pixel coordinates, scale and orientation of SIFT features. The control is based on geometric moments computed over an alterable set of redundant SIFT feature correspondences between the current and the reference view. The method is generic as it does not depend on a geometric object model but automatically extracts SIFT features from images of the object. The foundation of visual servoing on generic SIFT features renders the method robust with respect to loss of redundant features caused by occlusion or changes in view point. The moment based representation establishes an approximate one-to-one relationship between visual features and degrees of motion. This property is exploited in the design of a decoupled controller that demonstrates superior performance in terms of convergence and robustness compared with an inverse image Jacobian controller. Several experiments with a robotic arm equipped with a monocular eye-in-hand camera demonstrate that the approach is efficient and reliable.},
