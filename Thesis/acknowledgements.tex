Personally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their patience and emotional support through the years.

Professionally, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Firstname Lastname  for his input and guidance as I continuously hit roadblocks along the way.  It is unlikely that a graduate student could find a kinder and more supportive supervisor.  Without his help and the help of many other colleagues, I would have been at a loss.  Some colleagues whom I'd like to notably thank are: \texttt{Colleague1} for his collaboration during the early stages of this work; \texttt{Colleague2} for many fruitful discussions on the direction of this work; and \texttt{Colleague3}, for her advice relating to working with \textit{Anti-matter}.

Lastly, I would like to thank some other friends and colleagues who helped make my time at Western an enjoyable experience: Tony Stark, Steven Rodgers, Bruce Banner, Natasha Romanov, Thor Odinson, and Clint Barton.
